Splitting Files:

split -b 200 file part_ – Splits file into chunks of 200 bytes.

Join Files

join -1 2 -2 1 file1 file2 – Joins using column 2 of file1 and column 1 of file2.

Sorting Files
sort file – Sorts file content in in alphabetical order.

sort -r file – Sorts content in reverse of default sorting order.

sort -n file – this is actually used when the content is numeric it sorts in ascending order.

sort -rn file – this is also for numeric content ,as -r is used it reverses the default sorting(ascending order) and Sorts numbers in descending order.

sort -n -k3 file -- this sorts based on column here for example  i mentioned  3  so it sorts based on 3rd column and based on column data type here i choose -n as my third column is numerical.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day -8
The first line of the shell script file begins with a "sha-bang" (#!) which is not read as a comment, followed by the full path where the shell interpreter is located. 

This path, tells the operating system that this file is a set of commands to be fed into the interpreter indicated.

which command gives the path of the thing u need like 

which <installed software> like  ex: which python , which git 

—> use of this command is to check the path of its installment , and is it there or not .

Encapsulating the variable name with "" will preserve any white space values




greeting='Hello        world!'
echo $greeting" now with spaces: $greeting"



Encapsulating the variable name with ${} is used to avoid ambiguity , here to get a clear vision of the variable we use ${variable name}    THIS IS OPTIONAL

MyFirstLetters=ABC
echo "The first 10 letters in the alphabet are: ${MyFirstLetters}DEFGHIJ"

if [ m -eq 1]  ——— > -eq used for numerical

if [m == “sai”] ————> used for strings = or ==

Day 10 – CronTab Basics (Linux Task Scheduler)
==============================================

What is CronTab?
----------------
CronTab automates repetitive tasks on Linux (e.g., backups, monitoring, reports).

Basic Syntax:
-------------
* * * * * /path/to/script.sh
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of week (0–7, Sun=0/7)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1–12)
│ │ └────── Day of month (1–31)
│ └──────── Hour (0–23)
└────────── Minute (0–59)

Common Commands:
----------------
- crontab -l → List jobs
- crontab -e → Edit/add job

Examples:
---------
- Run every day at 9:30 PM:
  30 21 * * * /home/user/script.sh

- Run once at boot:
  @reboot /home/user/startup.sh

Shortcuts:
----------
@reboot  - At system startup
@daily   - Every day @ midnight
@weekly  - Every Sunday @ 12AM
@monthly - 1st of month @ 12AM
@yearly  - Jan 1st @ 12AM

Use Cases:
----------
- Start server at boot (@reboot)
- Disk usage check daily
- Auto-backup every week
- Log cleaner every hour
